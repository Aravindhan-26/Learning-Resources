The goal of this boot camp is to get each _student_ __started with the basics, broaden their horizon beyond their own research topic__, understand the tradeoffs of different approaches in our context (real-time, flying robots, etc.) and make our students more “dangerous” with some code/tools that they can use to jump start their research.
Sessions cover topics in Perception, State Estimation, Action, and Infrastructure. Each session will consist of a lecture followed by hands-on exercises.
